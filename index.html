            <br>This small web-site created as a study project, 
            but in same time I had in mind to create a portfolio for my dauther Sasha. 
            She's junior in High School and she's amazing artist and musician. 
            She has greate future! And I think customized web-portfolio might advance her chanses
            to get in to the college of her choice.</p>
