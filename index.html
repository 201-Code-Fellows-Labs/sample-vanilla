            <p>This small web-site created as a study project, 
            but in same time I had in mind to create a portfolio for my dauther Sasha. 
            She's junior in High School and she's amazing artist and musician. 
            She has greate future! And I think customized web-portfolio might advance her chanses
            to get in to the college of her choice.</p>

            <p>For now "portfolio" section of this web-site filled with Sasha's photos from last year photoshoot.
            Those photos were used for Washington music festival "WAgant" where she performed last Augast
            as singer and guitar player. As this site is taking shape altogether with my dev skills,
            I'm planning on creating multiple gallaries in the portfolio section for Sasha's drawings and paintings. 
            "Search" and blog as more advanced features would be nice addition to this project as well. </p>
            
            <h2 class="content-title2"> Here's what I've used for this site <span>development:</span></h2>
            <lu class="content-list">
           <li ><span>HTML</span></li>
           <li> <a href = "https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/">Jekyll Liquid </a> for templating </li>
           <li><span>CSS</span> - the majotiry of challenges I had was related to layout and css</li>
           <li><span> JavaScript </span>was used to create dynamic photo gallery in the portfolio 
            section with help of <a href =" https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp">HTML data-* Attributes</a></li>

             </lu>
           
            <p> Dalek image I put on header instead of a company logo was an inspiration for the site color-scheme 
                (dalek is a villain from my favorite TV show). </p>
