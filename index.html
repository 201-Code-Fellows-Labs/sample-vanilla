            <br>This small web-site created as a study project, 
            but in same time I had in mind to make a portfolio for my dauther Sasha. 
            She's junior in High School and she's amazing artist, musician and athlet.
            I've used her photos to create sample galleries. 
            <br><br>
              I've added a little bit of fun interaction to the site. Now to view gallery you have to
              tell me your name and answer simple question. Based on your input there will be one and only one gallery available for you. 
              But no worries - you always can come back to HOME page later and change your answers (may be something new will emerge for you!)
              Use site top navigation links after submitting your answers. <span>Enjoy!</span>
