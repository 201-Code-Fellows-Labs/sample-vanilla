      <p>I'm professional software breaker (QA, not hacker) with a dream to become pro-creator one day.
        I'm looking for an opportunity to advance my career by <span>learning programming</span>.</p>        
      <p>I love to work with people who know what they're doing and thrive to learn and grow. 
        I'd be honored to join innovative company with passionate team. 
        The team that embrace new ideas, new technologies and has ambitious to change the world (or some little bit of it) 
        <span>for better</span>.</p>

     <p>For now "portfolio" section of this web-site filled with Sasha's photos from last year photoshoot.
        Those photos were used for Washington music festival "WAgant" where she performed last Augast
        as singer and guitar player. As this site is taking shape altogether with my dev skills,
        I'm planning on creating multiple gallaries in the portfolio section for Sasha's drawings and paintings. 
        "Search" and blog as more advanced features would be nice addition to this project as well. </p>
        
        <h2 class="content-title2"> Here's what I've used for this site <span>development:</span></h2>
        <lu class="content-list">
       <li ><span>HTML</span></li>
       <li> <a href = "https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/">Jekyll Liquid </a> for templating </li>
       <li><span>CSS</span> - the majotiry of challenges I had was related to layout and css</li>
       <li><span> JavaScript </span>was used to create dynamic photo gallery in the portfolio 
        section with help of <a href =" https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp">HTML data-* Attributes</a></li>

        <p> Dalek image I put on header instead of a company logo was an inspiration for the site color-scheme 
            (dalek is a villain from my favorite TV show). </p>
