      <p>I'm professional software breaker (QA, not hacker) with a dream to become pro-creator one day.
        I'm looking for an opportunity to advance my career by <span>learning programming</span>.</p>        
      <p>I love to work with people who know what they're doing and thrive to learn and grow. 
        I'd be honored to join innovative company with passionate team. 
        The team that embrace new ideas, new technologies and has ambitious to change the world (or some little bit of it) 
        <span>for better</span>.</p>
