                 I'm highly experienced software QA professional looking for a opportunity to boost my career with development skills. 
                 I'm fast learner and achiever with passion for efficiency and quality. Recognizing miscommunications, ineffective processes and weak spots is one of my natural strengths. 
                 Planning, closing communication gaps and keeping things on track is what I do best. 
                 I love to learn new tech, passionate about great UX and design. 

                I love to work with people who know what they're doing and thrive to learn and grow. 
                I'd be honored to join innovative company with passionate team. The team that embrace new ideas, new technologies and has an ambitious to change the world (or some little bit of it) for better.
